# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) LeetCode Solutions using C++

Welcome to my repository where I showcase my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. This repository is a growing collection of solutions to common algorithmic challenges, categorized by difficulty.

## üöÄ Current Progress

### Easy Level

1. **Two Sum**
   - **Problem Statement:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
   - **Solution:** Implemented an efficient solution using a hash map to achieve O(n) time complexity.

2. **Palindrome**
   - **Problem Statement:** Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
   - **Solution:** Implemented a two-pointer technique to compare characters from both ends.

3. **Roman to Integer**
   - **Problem Statement:** Convert a given Roman numeral to its corresponding integer value, taking into account the subtraction rules for certain numeral pairs.
   - **Solution:** Implemented a mapping of Roman numerals to integers and iterated through the string, adding or subtracting values based on the numeral rules.

4. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**
   - **Problem Statement:** Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list by splicing together the nodes.
   - **Solution:** Implemented a two-pointer technique to iterate through both lists, merging nodes in sorted order into a new list.

5. **Longest Common Prefix**
   - **Problem Statement:** Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If no common prefix exists, return an empty string.
   - **Solution:** Implemented a horizontal scanning approach, comparing prefixes of each string iteratively to determine the longest common prefix.
