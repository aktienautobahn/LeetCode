# 35. Search Insert Position

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`nums = [1,3,5,6]`, `target = 5`

**Output:**  
`2`

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`nums = [1,3,5,6]`, `target = 2`

**Output:**  
`1`

### Example 3:

**Input:**  
`nums = [1,3,5,6]`, `target = 7`

**Output:**  
`4`

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`


## Solution
The solution uses binary search to find the target or its correct insertion position. The search iterates until the target is found or the insertion position is determined by adjusting the left (`l`) and right (`r`) pointers based on comparisons with the middle element (`mid`).
**Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` – Binary search reduces the search space logarithmically, resulting in efficient search within a sorted array.
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)` – Only a few extra variables are used for pointers and indices, independent of the input size.
