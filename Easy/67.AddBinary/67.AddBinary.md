## 67. **Add Binary**
   - **Problem statement:** Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.
   - **Example 1:**
     - **Input:** `a = "11"`, `b = "1"`
     - **Output:** `"100"`
   - **Example 2:**
     - **Input:** `a = "1010"`, `b = "1011"`
     - **Output:** `"10101"`
   - **Constraints:**
     - `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
     - `a` and `b` consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
     - Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.



## Solution:
Implement a full-adder logic to sum the binary strings. Start iterating from the least significant bit (end of the strings) and move towards the most significant bit, managing the carry. Append the result to a string and reverse it at the end to get the final binary sum.
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)` – Where `n` is the length of the longer binary string. Each bit is processed once in a single pass through the strings.
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)` – Additional space is used for the result string, which is proportional to the length of the input strings.
