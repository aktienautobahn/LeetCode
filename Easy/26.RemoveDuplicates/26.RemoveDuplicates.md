# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
**Solved**  
**Easy**

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`. To get accepted, you need to do the following things:
- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. 
- The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

## Custom Judge

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```cpp
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```
## Solutions 

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - The solution iterates through the array once, making it linear in relation to the number of elements `n` in the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, modifying the array in-place without needing additional memory that scales with input size.
