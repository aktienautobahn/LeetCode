# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
**Solved**  
**Easy**

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** `haystack = "sadbutsad"`, `needle = "sad"`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6. The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

### Example 2:
**Input:** `haystack = "leetcode"`, `needle = "leeto"`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:** "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

## Constraints

- `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4`
- `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m) - where `n` is the length of the `haystack` and `m` is the length of the `needle`. In the worst case, the algorithm may need to compare every character in `haystack` with every character in `needle`.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The space complexity is independent of the input string lengths since it only uses a few integer variables.
